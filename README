This is very very crude and assumes that your passwd GECOS field only contains "Firstname Lastname" and nothing else.
It is only compatible with FreeIPA 1.2 (and possible earlier), but not v2.

To use:

1. Copy /etc/passwd and /etc/group to the current directory.
2. Clean them up so that they only contain the data you want to import.
3. Run migrate.py and look at the output to see if it makes sense.
4. Change DEBUG to False and run migrate.py again
5. Run "getent passwd" and "getent group" to further verify
6. Fork this project on github, make it better, and let me know about it.
